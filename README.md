# VGMORDLE - The Video Game Music Heardle
Currently a work in progress - shoutouts to *sut_son* for getting the ball rolling with the code.

## Important Note
Like VGMB and VGMVersus before it, VGMORDLE relies on youtube uploads for its tracks. As such, in the event that any uploads are taken down, certain tracks will break the site. Apologies for any inconvenience.

## Roadmap
### Cursor History
Pressing Up and Down while focused on the input will cycle through input history.
### Skipping Unplayable Tracks
Already a thing for VGMVersus; just a case of porting code.
### Style Makeover
Making the site look more polished up.
### Additional Controls
eg: A volume slider, keymapping to skip or give up, etc.
