# VGMORDLE - The Video Game Music Heardle
Currently a work in progress - shoutouts to *sut_son* for getting the ball rolling with the code.

## Important Note
Like VGMB and VGMVersus before it, VGMORDLE relies on youtube uploads for its tracks. As such, in the event that any uploads are taken down, certain tracks will break the site. Apologies for any inconvenience.

## Shortcuts
Below is a compiled list of shortcuts I added for ease of use.
| Shortcut | Context | Use | 
| --- | --- | --- |
| Enter | Focused on input | Submits current input as guess ( will always use the topmost suggestion (in future, will change) ) |
| Enter | On endgame modal | Proceeds to the next track |
| Ctrl + Space | During the game | Plays the song |
| Ctrl + ArrowRight | During the game | Skips |
| Escape | Any time | Resets the game (in place of a dedicated restart) |


### Suggestions 
On top of this, you can also obviously click the buttons - play, submit, skip. You also click suggestions.

A **click** will copy the clicked suggestion to your input box.

**Ctrl + click** will submit that suggestion as a guess.

## Known Issues

## Roadmap
### Cursor History
Pressing Up and Down while focused on the input will cycle through input history.
### Skipping Unplayable Tracks
Already a thing for VGMVersus; just a case of porting code.
### Style Makeover
Making the site look more polished up.
### Additional Controls
eg: A volume slider, keymapping to skip or give up, etc.
### Add A Favicon
A new logo preferably, no ideas as of yet
